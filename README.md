# Overview  
This project provides a simulation environment for ion shuttling algorithms based on the QCCD (Quantum Charge-Coupled Device) architecture.
It is inspired by [MQT-Ion-Shuttler](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-ion-shuttler/tree/main) and implements ion shuttling using the MAPP (Multi-Agent Path Planning) approach.

# Getting Started
It requires Docker.
Run the following commands in your terminal to set up the environment:  

```sh
make build
make run
```

Once the container is running, navigate to the project directory and execute the program:

```sh
cd /home/jovyan/work
python3 main.py
```
